# AI in Engineering Handbook

A simple, internal handbook created to explain key concepts in modern, applied AI engineering. This project serves as a quick reference for engineers on topics ranging from frontier model capabilities to the practicalities of building AI agents.

The initial draft was created with Google AI Studio and the final version was built with Cursor.

## Content Overview

This handbook covers the following key topics:

- **Capabilities:** A comparison of frontier AI models (Gemini, GPT, Claude, etc.).
- **Prompting:** Principles and frameworks (ACES) for effective prompt engineering.
- **Context:** An explanation of context windows and management techniques like RAG.
- **Internal Data:** The challenge of unlocking proprietary data and the pipeline for making it AI-accessible.
- **MCP Servers:** The Model-Context-Protocol for building robust, stateful AI agents.
- **Agents:** The core concepts of agentic AI, including the "Observe, Think, Act" loop.

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:** Node.js

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    `npm install`
2.  **Run the development server:**
    `npm run dev`

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port).
